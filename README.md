# Analyze_AB_Tests_e-Commerce
Analyzing A/B test result for an eCommerce store.

The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

In order to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website, I
- Performed Exploratory Analysis to seek out answers to the objectives given.
- Fitted a Logistic Regression Model to predict if the new website will lead to more conversions.
 Assessed the data and determine if I have the correct information for my deliverable.
- Visualized and Presented my findings using interactive visualization tools like Tableau.
